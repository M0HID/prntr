# prntr
Welcome to the **prntr** project!

This is a 3d printer which is mainly optimised for speed. While the Bambu labs a1 mini that i have currently prints perfectly, it isnt the fastest when it comes to speed, especially startup calibration times required before every print.
## Features
- 100-150mms^-1 print speed
- 235x235 build plate
- Cheap
- Manual build plate levelling
- Cartesian system
