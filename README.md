# prntr
Welcome to the **prntr** project!

This is a 3d printer which is mainly optimised for speed. While the babu labs a1 mini that i have currently prints perfectly, it isnt the fastest when it comes to speed, especially startup calibration times required before every print.
## Features
- 100-150mms^-1 print speed
- 235x235 build plate
- Cheap
- Manual build plate levelling
- Cartesian system

## BOM

## Challenges
Almost everything was a challenge for me since I had barely used fusion 360 before this. I learnt a lot about CAD modelling in this project and a lot more about different 3d printers.
