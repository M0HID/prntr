- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

I've always wanted a 3D printer that can quickly print parts for prototyping. The Bambu Labs A1m I have right now takes ~7 minutes of calibrating before the print has even begun. Let's try to change that...

## Specs
- Needs to print decently fast (not slow)
- Should be able to print anything an A1 can print
- Should be able to start printing as quickly as possible (for rapid proto)

## Research - Time: 1 hour
- Looked into different motion systems, decided on a cartesian system similar to an ender 3 or an a1.

## Parts - Time: 4 hours
- Researched different parts on AliExpress for cheapest price, found some decent parts for cheap
- Decided to go for a simple cartesian printer similar to a prusa i3??

We are a littleee over budget atm but that should hopefully come down once we research cheaper alternatives/finalise parts.
